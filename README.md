# Sarcastic-Headline-Detection-with-BERT

### Problem

In this noteook, I will be predicting if a news headline is sarcasm. This News Headlines dataset for Sarcasm Detection is collected from two news website.   
**_The Onion_**, which aims at producing sarcastic versions of current events.   
**_The Huffington Post_**, which is a real (non-sarcastic) news outlet.  

The data in this project was provided by kaggle.com
